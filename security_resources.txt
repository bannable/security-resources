I WANT TO DO SECURITY BUT DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START:
  According to the NSA, "entry level" for security positions means one of:
    Bachelor's degree + 3 YOE
    Master's degree + 1 YOE
    Doctoral degree + 0 YOE
    Associate degree + 5 years in-depth experience directly related to the position
  BUG BOUNTY PROGRAMS are an effective way to perform legal security research and get some money for your time:
    BugCrowd
    HackerOne
    Syn/Ack
    Beware of any programs with no or very low $$$ awards. Your time is valuable.
