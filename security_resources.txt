I WANT TO DO SECURITY BUT DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START:
  https://danielmiessler.com/blog/build-successful-infosec-career/
  According to the NSA, "entry level" for security positions means one of:
    Bachelor's degree + 3 YOE
    Master's degree + 1 YOE
    Doctoral degree + 0 YOE
    Associate degree + 5 years in-depth experience directly related to the position
    TRANSLATION: ENTRY LEVEL POSITIONS DO NOT EXIST
  BUG BOUNTY PROGRAMS are an effective way to perform legal security research and get some money for your time:
    BugCrowd
    HackerOne
    Syn/Ack
    Beware of any programs with no or very low $$$ awards. Your time is valuable.
    Beware of scope violations: this can risk legal threats if the organization is hostile.

Tools:
  Ghidra - Free, open source decompiler
  IDA Free - Free, closed source decompiler, x86/x64 only
  IDA Pro - Not free, but way better
  GhIDA - from Cisco TALOS, use the Ghidra decompiler in IDA
  binary.ninja - https://binary.ninja, Non-free decompiler, massively better UX than IDA, very powerful
  Cheat Engine - real time memory editor for the lazy
  x64dbg - open source windows debugger, notable for good Scylla interface for dumping process memory
  Process Monitor - see what processes are actually doing
  pestudio - PE header inspector
  BURP Suite - MITM proxy for webapp pentesting
